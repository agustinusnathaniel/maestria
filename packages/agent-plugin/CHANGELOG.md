## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [#278](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel/maestria/pull/278) [`c770954`](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel/maestria/commit/c7709544f12393c98fa44b966cafc452a0aa5f84) Thanks [@agustinusnathaniel](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel)! - Clarify installation paths, prerequisites, and support boundaries in package documentation. Separate contributor validation from user setup and remove stale pre-release wording.

- [#281](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel/maestria/pull/281) [`5c5729b`](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel/maestria/commit/5c5729b0f70d54f4181b2a5a2f1aad87fe0a92af) Thanks [@agustinusnathaniel](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel)! - Fix stale skill references so prescribed skills resolve at load time: planner skill guidance no longer names the removed `to-issues` and `to-prd` skills, and the duplicated Kimi orchestrator skill prescription (which restated canonical skill governance and drifted stale) is removed so `sync.config.ts` only adapts toward the plugin runtime. Clarify in the orchestrator's Role-Based Pipeline that `@diagnose` analyzes the bug, applies the minimal fix, and verifies the repair instead of grouping it with analyze-only thinkers. Correct the canonical agent-directives README index to count 8 pipeline agents (orchestrator + 7 specialists) and list `orchestrator.md`.

- [#280](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel/maestria/pull/280) [`7c038cd`](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel/maestria/commit/7c038cd28448149f4154510ee0866f0a3ef523f8) Thanks [@agustinusnathaniel](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel)! - Make agent investigation, verification, skill loading, and output structure proportional to the task. Preserve complete assignment ownership and delivery, allow necessary in-scope regression coverage, and keep downstream instructions independent of Maestria repository paths.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [#275](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel/maestria/pull/275) [`56351de`](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel/maestria/commit/56351debf73a97c24eb10826517e0d9aabeaca6b) Thanks [@agustinusnathaniel](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel)! - Refine specialist engineering judgment around trust-boundary normalization, feature-local seams, shared-interface compatibility, executable sources of truth, staged migrations, durable diagnostic knowledge, and operational documentation.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#269](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel/maestria/pull/269) [`ef07bf7`](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel/maestria/commit/ef07bf78a8e5f676c76b55680301bc7c839b68a9) Thanks [@agustinusnathaniel](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel)! - Add conditional visual-evidence guidance for PR delivery: confirm the project targets GitHub with authenticated gh --attach support and an available capture tool before attaching a screenshot or short video for visual or behavioral changes. Vision is optional verification only, not a precondition.

- [#269](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel/maestria/pull/269) [`ef07bf7`](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel/maestria/commit/ef07bf78a8e5f676c76b55680301bc7c839b68a9) Thanks [@agustinusnathaniel](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel)! - Add a global testing-judgment rule (test artifacts are opt-in, behavior over implementation shape, mocks only at external seams) and align reviewer and diagnose guidance with it.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#265](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel/maestria/pull/265) [`4dcbf04`](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel/maestria/commit/4dcbf0430e8d9f2143762a44e1d56729e238107d) Thanks [@agustinusnathaniel](https://github.com/agustinusnathaniel)! - Add a first-class Agent Plugins v1 package that exposes Maestria's methodology as a portable, skills-only plugin, plus CLI commands to validate and stage portable packages.
